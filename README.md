Analyzing the most strategic words to guess on Wordle, based on letter frequency distributions

## The Data

`12972` [guessable words](./word_list_data/guessable_words.csv)  
`2315` [mystery words](./word_list_data/mystery_words.csv)\*

_\* = These words comprise a word bank that is hard-coded into the  
Wordle source code and used to randomly pick the daily puzzle each day_

## Exploratory Analysis

#### Most common letters

In the words of Pat Sajak, "R, S, T, L, N, E". These are the most frequently appearing letters in the English language and are, as such, used in the Bonus Round of the game Wheel of Fortune. But I wanted to start this project by verifying if they are, in fact, the most frequent letters when we limit our scope to only _5-letter_ English words.

As it turns out, `E`, `A`, `R`, `O`, `T`, `L`, `I`, `S` are the most frequent letters that appear in 5-letter words. Now, quick, think of a 5-letter word using these letters!

## Simple Scoring Heuristics

Suppose today's Wordle solution is `CRIMP`.

Guess 1: `RAISE` => ðŸŸ¨â¬›ðŸŸ©â¬›â¬› (R is present in the word, but not in the right place)  
Guess 2: `MOUNT` => ðŸŸ¨â¬›â¬›â¬›â¬› (M is present in the word, but not in the right place)  
Guess 3: `GRIME` => â¬›ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©â¬› (R, I, and M are all correct and locked in)  
Guess 4: `CRIMP` => ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ© (ðŸŽ‰ yay, you solved the Wordle! ðŸŽ‰)
